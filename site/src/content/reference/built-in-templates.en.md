---

AntV Infographic has multiple built-in infographic templates that can be tried directly on the [Examples](/gallery) page to quickly generate finished products.

Use [getTemplates](/reference/infographic-exports#get-templates) to get the complete template list, or get configuration by ID through [getTemplate](/reference/infographic-exports#get-template).

If you need customization, you can register your own templates with [registerTemplate](/reference/infographic-exports#register-template).
